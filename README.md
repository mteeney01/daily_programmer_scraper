# daily_programmer_scraper
Script that scrapes the daily programmer subreddit and stores the challenges locally (as .md files)

```sh
python ./challenge-scraper.py
```

This will create a challenges directory at the current location, along with subdirectories for the [Easy],[Intermediate], and [Hard] challenges.
